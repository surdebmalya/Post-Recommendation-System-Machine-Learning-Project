# Post-Recommendation-System-Machine-Learning-Project
## Summary of My Work
There are two methods to implement a recommendation system :
- Content Based Filtering
- Collaborative Filtering Method

Here, I have done with both of these processes!
## Structure of Dataset
It is a post recommendation system. In the **Mldata** folder there are three csv files.
- users.csv is the details for the users
- posts.csv is the details for posts
- views.csv is the details for the which user has visit which post.
